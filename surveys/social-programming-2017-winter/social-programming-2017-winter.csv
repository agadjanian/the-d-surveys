I think if we used Common Ground for more social events (dances) that'd be great. Quality music is lacking on this campus. DASA LLC formal was EPIC, at McLaughlin. Literally that was a scene. We need great DJs, thankfully the 19s back us up. At other Ivies they host parties in their student center, I think more of those would be great bc frat/ponging is kind of dull. I love dancing and lit music. I think that's where Greek life succeeds in doing, and alt social spaces should work on. Of course, we do have Cutter and LALACS parties, which are both great. I'm not sure if Bar Hop has dancing; I often can't go because it's in the middle of the week. So it would be great if Collis hosted one or two of these a term on a Friday or Saturday.

Having dance parties/formals outside of the Greek system would also be cool. In my opinion, Dartmouth should give more funding and support to the Living Learning Communities whose events have good attendance, and spend less funds on House Community events that people do not attend. The one event I attended at my House was supposed to be a major advising session. They had ordered about 15 Dominos pizzas. I was the only person who showed up. That's just wasteful. I think the House communities are trying really hard and I appreciate the effort, but I really don't think any of the upperclassmen students identify with their House communities and so I really don't think House events are a good way to try to attract students to alternative social spaces. The best events are those that attract people who are likely to attend Greek events -- for example, I've had friends who normally would go out but will instead go see a free movie at the Hop or go blacklight mini golfing, because those are the most widely-appealing alternative events. By contrast, in my experience very few people ever attend the craft-based events.","First, I would empower female dominated social spaces to host events; while not ""alternative,"" such events would have a notably different vibe from the parties hosted in frats, which unfortunately sometimes lend themselves to sexism. Personally, I have found a really great community through my LLC, the Thought Project, and I think Dartmouth should continue to support its LLCs, which empower students to self-select into communities they care about (unlike the House system, which arbitrarily sorts students into random groups not based on interest and thus less likely to inspire commitment and engagement). In my experience, students are more likely to interact socially with other members of their LLCs than with their House communities, so I'd love to see Dartmouth expand the LLC model. I think the best thing Collis can do is offer events that are novel, exciting, and free, that attract people away from the frats for a night. Some of my favorite events have been blacklight minigolf/lazer tag, free movies, and spa nights, and I think these are the events that are so different from anything you could find in frats that they attract even affiliated students.","Woman","","2019","None","White","No"

The ultimate frisbee community is also a co-ed, low-risk, fun, inclusive, student run community that is very successful.

Communities exist already that provide great alternatives to greek life AND are also student run. Start by supporting them. No matter what– there will be no good alternative to greek life that is not student run. Students should be trusted to run their own communities.","Man","","2017","None","White","No"
